# OmronFinsRC8

**OmronFinsRC8** is a project I initially worked on to implement communication between a **Denso RC8** robot and an OMRON controller using the **FINS** protocol. While I successfully got it working in its early stages, I didn’t have the time or resources to fully complete it. Eventually, I decided to switch to **EtherDOG** for my needs, and this project was scrapped as a result.

However, I’m releasing the code as a base for anyone interested in finishing or expanding upon it. If you are looking to implement the **OMRON FINS** protocol with a Denso RC8 robot, this could be a good starting point.

## Status

The project is **unfinished**, and the implementation is currently partial. It includes a working foundation for the FINS communication but lacks full functionality, documentation, and additional features.

Feel free to fork the repository and contribute to it. I’d be happy to see others take it to completion!
